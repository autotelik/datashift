# Have editor/IDE/OS specific files you need to ignore? Consider using a global gitignore: 
#
# * Create a file at ~/.gitignore
# * Include files you want ignored
# * Run: git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
#
# After doing this, these files will be ignored in all your git projects,
# saving you from having to 'pollute' every project you touch with them
#
# Not sure what to needs to be ignored for particular editors/OSes? Here's some ideas to get you started. (Remember, remove the leading # of the line)
#
# For MacOS:
#
.DS_Store

# For TextMate
#*.tmproj
#tmtags

# For emacs:
#*~
#\#*
#.\#*

# For vim:
*.swp

# For redcar:
#.redcar

# For rubinius:
#*.rbc
